# Random scripts

This repository contains some random scripts:

- `AppsScripts`
  - `sortOnEdit.js`: This script leverages Google Apps Script to automate the updating of your To-do list on Google Sheets. It dynamically sorts tasks based on priority changes, automatically marks completed tasks as done, and highlights tasks that still need prioritization.
